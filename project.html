              <strong>Employees are the most valuable and important asset in any business. With the right employees, a business can strive to new heights, win against competitors, and grow continuously.
                 The process of recruitment consists of multiple subprocesses such as attacking, screening and selecting qualified people to occupy a job or a vacancy at a company. 
                 Nowadays, hiring new employees is not an easy task. As a result, a job offer receives hundreds, if not thousands, of applicants. Consequently, recruitment became a tedious task requiring tremendous human and time resources. 
                 The aim of this project is to design a digital recruitment system that helps in the processes of recruitment and selection.By integrating various technologies such as Natural Language Processing and Python to develop a website that would benefit both job applicants and companies.
                 The proposed system will allow job applicants to search for job offers and upload their resumes. Moreover, it will allow companies to upload job offers, provide job requirements, etc.
                 The proposed system will filter the uploaded resumes and provide a score for each based on the set requirements. Lastly, the system is evaluated to select the best candidate and provide them to the company.
                 This report summarizes the various phases of the development of the website as well as the evaluation result.</strong>

                 Also, it allows job seekers to search, view, and apply for jobs by uploading their CVs. For each job posted, the website previews the applicants for the company along with the CV score for each one.
                 In addition, the company can sort the results to list the top candidates.
                 Checking the correctness of info stated in the CV of applicants or testing applicants’ knowledge levels is out of the scope for this project.</strong>
